Artist’s Statement
THE Bubble is an interactive game I created using JavaScript, designed to explore the concept of community through movement and visual metaphor. In this game, bubbles represent individuals in our society. When the game begins, the bubbles are scattered individually across the canvas—just as people might initially feel isolated in a larger social system. The player controls a single red bubble (representing “us”), which begins to interact with the others. As the red bubble merges with other bubbles, they become one. Slowly, an isolated bubble transforms into a visual representation of a growing community.
Artistically, my goal was to show this transformation clearly. The merging of bubbles is meant to symbolize connection, unity, and the creation of a collective identity. I intentionally kept the visual design minimal—using basic shapes and a limited color palette—to keep the focus on the concept rather than visual complexity. The game is not meant to be difficult, but rather thoughtful and enjoyable, encouraging players to reflect on the meaning behind the action of merging.
Technically, the project has two phases. First, I developed two versions of the game using JavaScript. One version is simple, allowing the red bubble to merge with any other bubble. The other is more challenging: the red bubble can only merge with other red bubbles, and merging with differently colored bubbles ends the game. I ultimately chose to use the simpler version because it worked more smoothly with the motion data from ZIG SIM PRO.
Second, I introduced real-time movement by connecting a smartphone running ZIG SIM PRO. The phone captures motion data, which is sent to a WebSocket server. This data is then used to control the red bubble's movement. During testing, I noticed that due to a slight delay in data transmission, the red bubble's movement was not as smooth as expected. Surprisingly, this delay made the game more engaging. Test players agreed that the unexpected "bug" added an element of challenge and made the experience more interesting.
In the end, I believe the project successfully merges both artistic and technical elements to create a simple yet meaningful interaction. Players don’t just play a game—they witness and participate in the visual formation of a community.
